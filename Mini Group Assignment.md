### Project title and link to proposal
Title: Affordable Housing Projects and Environmental Risk in Los Angeles
Link: [(proposal)](https://github.com/richardrbg/DH-140-Group-Project/blob/main/Group%20Assignment%20%231.md)  
 
### Roles 
Richard: **Lead Senior Machine Learning Engineer** Use classification algorithms if useful and effectively use mapping visualizations.

Haley: **Data and Content Specialist** Ensure data is cleaned and presented in an effective and meaningful way that supports our research question(s). Lead the research/sources portion of the project to supplement our data.  
 
### Status update 
Neutral. We’ve just been building off of what is taught in class and that usually propels the work forward. If the class lessons aren’t directly relevant to our topic then it may not broaden our abilities to work with the data but at least we are becoming more familiar with the coding aspect. 
 
### Data update 
Richard: I’ve been using related census data to look at fundamental housing issues that Los Angeles faces. I was looking at income and the available housing varying across LA census tracts. This can be used to find insights to where the more affordable housing lies and the health and environmental factors in that area. My next steps will be to compare this directly to affordable housing projects and ideally have a mapping visualization.

Haley: I explored the poverty to income ratios by census tracts in Los Angeles using census data. This gave me a better idea of where some of the most economically and thus environmentally vulnerable families are geographically distributed in LA (based on our other datasets).  (for some reason the census tracts are not currently showing up, but the exploration I did included census tract data). [(data)](https://censusreporter.org/data/table/?table=C17026&geo_ids=16000US0644000&primary_geo_id=16000US0644000) I also plan to use the HCIDLA Affordable Housing Projects List (2003 to Present) data to examine what communities these projects are located in and what types of housing projects are most common, and the stages they are at (particularly the ones in the ‘development stage’, as this gives insight into the current state and direction of affordable housing projects / where they are heading).

### Concerns
#### Major concerns:
1. Flexibility of data, I don’t think everything we learn in class will be doable on our datasets. 
2. Merging the datasets to from various sources to find the overlap that pertains to our research question
3. It doesn’t feel like there are many framework guidelines/direction for the project
 
#### Minor concerns:
1. Using data to enforce the research narrative
2. Finding research papers already on the topic
3. Lacking advanced enough skills to thoroughly investigate this topic and provide meaningful results.
