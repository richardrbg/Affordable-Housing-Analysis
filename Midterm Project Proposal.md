## Research Question
Where are affordable housing projects being built in Los Angeles? What neighborhoods or areas are at higher risk for environmental harm, particularly by multiple sources of pollution? Are affordable housing projects being developed in areas that are at higher levels of environmental vulnerability? What types of affordable housing projects are there?

## Why it is important to us, why it matters to others and what is at stake
This research question is important to us because the cityâ€™s solutions need to be checked that they are stable and effective for renters. In particular, environmental factors should not go unchecked when trying to accommodate new solutions. Those who should benefit from affordable housing should not be subjected to poor standard of living due to environmental risks (pollution, etc.). The health and dangers of the people of LA should be taken seriously. Moreover, there is varying types of housing projects that can be investigated along with the environmental risks.

## Description of the spatial scope and why space and/or time matters
The spatial scope of this project is the city of Los Angeles. Los Angeles serves as an excellent target city to study our research question because it is facing a housing crisis and is also notorious for air pollution. LA is diverse geographically and socioeconomically, adding to the variability within its own city limits. 

## Preliminary description of data source 
**Data source 1: Affordable Housing Projects List** This data includes affordable housing projects financed by HCIDLA through several local and state programs from 2003-present. This project list contains participants, property, units, construction and milestone information. https://data.lacity.org/Housing-and-Real-Estate/HCIDLA-Affordable-Housing-Projects-List-2003-to-Pr/mymu-zi3s  
 
**Data source 2: CalEnviroScreen** This data identifies California communities by census tract that are disproportionately burdened by, and vulnerable to, multiple sources of pollution.  https://oehha.ca.gov/calenviroscreen/report/calenviroscreen-30 
 
**Data source 3: Monthly Housing Costs** Includes the percentage of renters in different housing cost brackets among the different census tracts in LA. This gives insight to fundamental issues of LA housing. https://censusreporter.org/data/table/?table=B25104&geo_ids=16000US0644000,140%7C16000US0644000&primary_geo_id=16000US0644000#

**Data source 4: Poverty levels of Family in Past 12 Months** Gives us better idea of where some of the most economically and thus environmentally vulnerable families are geographically distributed in LA https://censusreporter.org/data/table/?table=C17026&geo_ids=16000US0644000&primary_geo_id=16000US0644000



## Scope that explains the intended analysis and resulting visualizations 
We can study the correlation between affordable housing locations and areas of environmental hazard. We can take input from selected factors that create health risks (as a result of the environment) anywhere in LA and see how all locations compare to specifically the affordable housing projects. We can impose our health risks scores across a map of LA (using a color gradient) and highlight the housing projects. This can further be segmented to study the types of affordable housing being built.


## Concluding paragraph of what insights we expect to gain from the research
From this research, we hope to gain insight into whether the city of LA is adequately taking into account environmental health risk when expanding and implementing new affordable housing projects. We also hope to gain a better understanding, more generally, of which communities in Los Angeles are most vulnerable to health risks due to pollution, and where exactly these affordable housing developments are located in the city.
